Algorithm StringMatch(txt,pat)
# txt is a string we are checking
# pat is a the pattern we are checking for in t
t = length of txt
p = length of pat
patHash = hashCode of pat
for i = 0 to (t-p+1)
    chunk = substring of txt from i to i+p
    if hash(chunk) == patHash
        for a = 0 to p-1
            if pat[a]==chunk[a]
                continue
            else
                break
        print (pattern found at index i)
